# desidithering

NOTE: this was early development work and is not in use for DESI dithering tests so the repo has been archived (i.e. it is now read-only).

Examples and applications for dithering.

These examples and applications work with specsim.dithering branch.

These examples and applications were tested with python 3.5.3. Please notify me if you have any issues with other versions.
